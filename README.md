# Titanic_ML_tree_decision

Short info
-----------

<b>The project's name:</b> `Titanic ML with decision tree`

<b>Creator:</b> `Daniil Khmelnytskyi`

<b>About the project:</b>
This project predicts will people stay alive or not using one of the machine learning algorithms - `decision tree`.

<b>Results:</b>
`Decision tree` has showed better results then `random forest`.
`Accuracy` of trained model is `99.28%`.
However, the accuracy depends on the argument `max_depth` during initializing of model. `Max_depth=3` showed the best result.
